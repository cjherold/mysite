# This is the repo for my personal website.

###### I'm currently rebuilding my site in React so you may find some bugs. I previously built it using my Spark website builder. The docs folder is basically React's build folder but Github pages expects a certain format.
#### Home
* The main splash page that just has a little info about myself.
#### Sudoku
* A sudoku game made using javascript.
#### Quizbuilder
* A simple page that uses a json object to build a quiz.

#### Mailcall
* A tool for building mailto links.


# TODO
* Get all pages working
* Clean up code and organize things more
* Style dark/light mode and toggle switch?
